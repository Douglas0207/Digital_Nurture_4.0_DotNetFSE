# Assignment 1 – Web API using ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)

### Student: Robinson Douglas  
### Week: 4  
### Assignment: Create a simple Web API with Read/Write operations

---

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of RESTful Web Service, Web API, and Microservices
- Learn about HTTP request and response flow
- Understand action verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Learn common HTTP status codes
- Create a simple Web API using .NET Core
- Test the API using Swagger UI

---

## Tools Used

- **Operating System:** macOS  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  
- **.NET SDK Version:** 8.0.411  
- **API Testing Tool:** Swagger (built-in)
- **Terminal:** macOS zsh/bash terminal

---

## Steps Performed

### Step 1: Created Web API Project

Used the following command to create the project:
- `dotnet new webapi -n Assignment1`

This created a basic Web API template with a sample controller (`WeatherForecastController`).

### Step 2: Explored Swagger UI

- Ran the application using `dotnet run`
- Navigated to `http://localhost:[port]/swagger`
- Saw the default endpoint `/weatherforecast` listed
- Used **Try it out → Execute** to see JSON response of dummy weather data

### Step 3: Created Custom `ValuesController` with CRUD Operations

Manually added a new controller `ValuesController` with the following endpoints:

- GET `/api/values` – List all values
- GET `/api/values/{id}` – Get value by index
- POST `/api/values` – Add a new value
- PUT `/api/values/{id}` – Update a value at index
- DELETE `/api/values/{id}` – Remove value at index

All methods return appropriate status codes such as:
- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 204 No Content
- 404 Not Found

Tested all actions using Swagger UI.

## Output Samples

- `GET /api/values` returned:
  - `["value1", "value2"]`
- `POST /api/values` with `"value3"` updated list to:
  - `["value1", "value2", "value3"]`
- `PUT /api/values/1` changed `value2` to `updatedValue2`
- `DELETE /api/values/0` removed `value1`
