# Entity Framework Core 8.0 - Retail Inventory System ðŸ›’

This assignment demonstrates the use of **Entity Framework Core 8.0** in a .NET console application to manage a simple Retail Inventory System.

### âœ… What I did:

- Set up a `DbContext` with Entity Framework Core 8.0.
- Created models for `Category` and `Product`.
- Registered services using **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**.
- Implemented a basic repository pattern for managing products.
- Used dependency injection to add and retrieve products from an in-memory database.
- Displayed product details along with their category in the console.
