# Final Lab â€“ Reading Data from the Database Using EF Core ðŸ§¾

This task demonstrates how to retrieve and display data from a SQL Server database using **Entity Framework Core** in a .NET console application.

### âœ… What I did:

- Created a data access class (`RetrieveData`) to encapsulate all read operations.
- Used the `AppDbContextFactory` to create a properly configured `DbContext`.
- Queried both `Categories` and `Products` tables using LINQ.
- Displayed retrieved data in a structured, readable format in the console.
- Validated that the database contains previously seeded records.

This task highlights best practices for **reading data using EF Core**, including dependency separation and clean console output formatting.
