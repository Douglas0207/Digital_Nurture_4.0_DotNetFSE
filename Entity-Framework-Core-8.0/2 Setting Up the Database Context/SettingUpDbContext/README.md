# Lab 2 ‚Äì Setting Up the Database Context üõ†Ô∏è

This lab focuses on the initial setup required for working with **Entity Framework Core** in a .NET application.

### ‚úÖ What I did:

- Created a new .NET console application for Lab 2.
- Set up the project structure for database interaction using EF Core.
- Prepared the foundation for configuring and using `DbContext` in upcoming labs.
- Verified setup with a simple console message to confirm the context is ready.

---

This lab ensures that the development environment is ready for deeper EF Core usage in future assignments.
