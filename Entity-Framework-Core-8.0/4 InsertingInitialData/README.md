# Lab 4 â€“ Retrieving and Displaying Data ðŸ“Š

This lab focuses on retrieving data from the database and displaying it in the console using **Entity Framework Core**.

### âœ… What I did:

- Used a factory class to create an instance of the `AppDbContext`.
- Retrieved all records from the `Categories` and `Products` tables.
- Displayed the data in a structured format in the console.
- Validated that the data previously seeded in the database (via earlier labs) was successfully read and displayed.

---

This lab highlights the power of **LINQ with EF Core** for reading data from relational databases and rendering meaningful output in a console application.
