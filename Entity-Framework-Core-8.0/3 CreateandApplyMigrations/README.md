This lab demonstrates how to configure and use **Entity Framework Core** to create and apply migrations in a .NET application using SQL Server.

### âœ… What I did:

- Set up a database connection using `appsettings.json` and `ConfigurationBuilder`.
- Configured `DbContextOptions` to use **SQL Server** with the provided connection string.
- Created EF Core models for `Category` and `Product`.
- Applied migrations to generate and update the database schema.
- Seeded initial data (e.g., Electronics and Groceries categories with products).
- Successfully saved the data to the database and confirmed via a console message.
