# React – Exercise 1

## Objective

In this exercise, I learned to:

- Define Single Page Application (SPA) and understand its benefits  
- Understand what React is and how it works  
- Compare SPA and Multi Page Applications (MPAs)  
- Explain the pros and cons of SPAs  
- Learn about the Virtual DOM  
- Explore key features of React  
- Set up the React development environment using create-react-app  

## What I Did

I started by installing Node.js and npm, which are required to run React applications. Then, I used the create-react-app tool to generate a new React project named `myfirstreact`.

After creating the project, I opened it in Visual Studio Code, went to the `App.js` file inside the `src` folder, and replaced its content to display a simple heading:  
**"Welcome to the first session of React"**

Finally, I ran the project using the terminal and opened it in the browser at `localhost:3000` to see the output.
