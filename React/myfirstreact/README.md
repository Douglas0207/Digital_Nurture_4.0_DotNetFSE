## Exercise 1: Introduction to React and SPA

### Objectives

- Define Single-Page Applications (SPA) and their benefits
- Compare SPA and MPA
- Understand what React is
- Explain the concept of Virtual DOM
- Identify key features of React

### What I Did

- I set up a React environment using `create-react-app`
- I installed Node.js and npm on my system
- I used terminal commands to scaffold a new React app
- I explored the folder structure generated by React
- I modified the default `App.js` file to display a custom heading
- I ran the application locally and verified the output on `localhost:3000`

### Summary

I created a React application named `myfirstreact` using the `create-react-app` CLI tool. Then, I replaced the default JSX in `App.js` with a heading:  
**"Welcome to the first session of React"**.  
Finally, I launched the development server using `npm start` and confirmed the output in my browser.
