# React – Exercise 2

## Objective

In this exercise, I learned to:

- Understand what React components are and how they work  
- Identify the differences between regular JavaScript functions and React components  
- Learn about the two main types of components: class components and function components  
- Understand how class components are built using constructors and the render() method  

## What I Did

I created a new React project called `StudentApp` using the create-react-app tool. Inside the `src` folder, I created a new folder named `Components` to organize all the custom components.

I built three components:

- **Home** – shows the message: "Welcome to the Home page of Student Management Portal"  
- **About** – shows the message: "Welcome to the About page of the Student Management Portal"  
- **Contact** – shows the message: "Welcome to the Contact page of the Student Management Portal"  

Each of these was created in its own file. Then, I imported all three components into `App.js` and rendered them together. After running the project, I opened it in the browser using `localhost:3000` to see all the messages displayed.
