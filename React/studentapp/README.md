## Exercise 2: Class and Function Components

### Objectives

- Understand the concept of React components
- Learn the differences between class components and function components
- Build and render multiple components inside a React application

### What I Did

- I created a new React app named `secondreact`
- I built two types of components: one class-based and one function-based
- I used these components to display a student's name and registration number
- I explored how class components use `render()` while function components return JSX directly
- I imported both components into `App.js` and rendered them together

### Summary

In this exercise, I created a class component and a functional component to understand their structure and usage. I practiced how to define, export, and render components in a React application. This helped me understand the foundation of component-based architecture in React.
