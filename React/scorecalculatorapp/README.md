# React – Exercise 3

## Objective

In this exercise, I learned to:

- Understand function components in React  
- See how they differ from class components and regular JavaScript functions  
- Apply styling to components using external CSS  
- Render and display data dynamically using props  

## What I Did

I created a new React project called `scorecalculatorapp` using create-react-app. Inside the `src` folder, I added a new folder named `Components` and created a function component named `CalculateScore`.

This component accepted a student's **Name**, **School**, **Total**, and **Goal**, and then calculated and displayed the average score based on that data.

To enhance the appearance of the component, I also created a separate `Stylesheets` folder and added a CSS file named `mystyle.css`. I applied custom styles to make the component look clean and readable.

Finally, I rendered the `CalculateScore` component inside `App.js`, ran the project, and opened it in the browser at `localhost:3000` to check the output.
